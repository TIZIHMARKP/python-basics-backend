# A Happy Number is a positive integer that, when you repeatedly replace the number by the sum of the squares 
# of its digits and continue the process, eventually reaches 1. 
# If the process never reaches 1 but instead loops endlessly in a cycle, the number is not a Happy Number.

# For example:
# 19 is a Happy Number because:
# 1^2 + 9^2 = 82
# 8^2 + 2^2 = 68
# 6^2 + 8^2 = 100
# 1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 1

# The process reaches 1, so 19 is a Happy Number

def is_happy_number(num):
    seen = set() #

    while num != 1 and num not in seen:
        seen.add(num)
        num = sum(int(i) ** 2 for i in str(num))

    return num == 1

# 
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if is_happy_number(num):
    print(f"{num} is a Happy Number")
else:
    print(f"{num} is not a Happy Number")
